I instructed an undergraduate MATLAB course at Amirkabir University of Technology during the Fall 2021 term. The course aimed to equip students with fundamental programming skills in MATLAB, focusing on numerical computations, algorithm implementation, and data visualization.

Course Structure
======

The course was structured to cover a wide array of topics, ensuring students were well-versed in the MATLAB environment. The syllabus was designed to take students from the basics of MATLAB installation to advanced topics such as scripting, data handling, and complex mathematical computations.

Syllabus Highlights
======

- MATLAB Installation and Environment: Scripting, live scripting, and executing code in the command window.
- MATLAB Basics: Fundamental principles for newcomers to get started with MATLAB.
- Advanced Topics: Diving deeper into arrays, matrices, control flow, operators, and functions.
- Plotting and Visualization: Learning to use MATLAB for 2D and 3D visualizations.
- Algorithm Implementation: Developing simple algorithms to solve problems and automate tasks.

Self-Paced Learning Path
======

For students who wished to pursue the course material independently, I curated a set of comprehensive resources and exercises available on the internet. This allowed for a self-paced learning environment where students could engage with the content outside of a structured classroom setting.
