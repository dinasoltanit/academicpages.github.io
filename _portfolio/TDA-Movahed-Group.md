## Topological Data Analysis of Dark Matter Density Field in the N-body Simulations
- **Duration**: 10/2021 - 07/2022
- **Type of Research**: Computational, Data Science, Theoretical
- **Institution or Organization**: Complex Systems Laboratory, Shahid Beheshti University
- **Supervisor**: Dr. Mohammad Sadegh Movahed

#### Description
This project saw us exploring the mysterious cosmic web, aiming to understand its evolving topological structure through topological data analysis. Leveraging Persistent Homology, our team mapped the redshift evolution of large-scale cosmic structures, scrutinizing the interactions within the cosmological standard model and the dark matter-energy continuum from redshifts z=46.8 to z=0.
