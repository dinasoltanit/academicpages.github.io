#### Description
As a PhD student, my research is pioneering in the field of compressible turbulence, focusing on scale dynamics. The objective is to extend the established incompressible theories, such as Richardson-Kolmogorov-Onsager, to compressible systems. A significant aspect of my work involves demonstrating the scale locality of the energy cascade, even amidst discontinuities like shocks. Through comprehensive analyses involving Normal Shock and the viscous unforced Burger's equation, I aim to solidify the theoretical underpinnings of compressible turbulence.
