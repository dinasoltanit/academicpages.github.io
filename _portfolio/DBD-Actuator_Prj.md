#### Description
My bachelor's research was dual-faceted, focusing on both the electrodynamic analysis and computational modeling of Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) actuators. Initially, I delved into the simulation of plasma layers in actuators, exploring their electrodynamic properties. Subsequently, I extended my research to the computational modeling of DBD actuators, integrating the effects of low-frequency plasmons into aerodynamic simulations, which significantly enhanced our understanding of plasma actuation processes.
