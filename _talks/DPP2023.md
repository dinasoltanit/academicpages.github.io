This talk discusses the challenge to the commonly held belief that kinetic energy (KE) in the presence of a shock does not undergo an inertial scale-local cascade. Presenting rigorous mathematical analysis and physical arguments, the authors Dina Soltani Tehrani and Hussein Aluie dismantle the traditional view, showing that KE can cascade through scales in a shock scenario. Examples from Burgers equation and exact 1D normal shock solutions provide evidence that scale-locality of the energy transfer is indeed possible without the need for homogeneity or isotropy. The findings could have a significant impact on our understanding of turbulence across different Mach numbers and without strict assumptions regarding the equations of state.
